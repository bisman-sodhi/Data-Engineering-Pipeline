# Data Engineering with Medallion Architecture using DBT, Databricks, Spark and Azure Cloud 
* This project illustrate the process of data ingestion to the lakehouse, data integration with ADF and data transformation with Databricks, and DBT.
* Used Azure SQL Database to load data into Azure Data Lake Storage and integrated data with Azure Data Factory 
* Implemented Medallion Architecture in Databricks to transform raw data into polished data
* Implemented DBT Snapshot to transform data in the various layers of Medallion Architecture
* Results showed organized data flow, efficient processing, and clear separation of concerns across different data processing stages
